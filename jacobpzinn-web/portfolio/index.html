  <h1>Jacob Zinn: aka: Boxer the horse</h1>
  <h2>As introduced in "Animal Farm"</h2>

  <hr>
  <p> I've worked at the same sports analytics software startup since day one. This environment of few resources and a tight-knit team of 4 to 6 members has enabled me to become a self-managed, versatile, and resourceful aspiring entrepreneur. When big or small tasks arise needing immediate attention, I have been, and will continue to be, the go-to guy to get the job done. I dream of the all-nighters, sorrows, successes, and strokes of creative brilliance accompanying the life of a creator and entrepreneur. </p>
