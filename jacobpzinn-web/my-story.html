        <p><strong>I'm really not about to write a whole story, but a few days ago a friend suggested that we both write
                poems and have them judged. Judge?</strong></p>

                Let’s play a game<br>
                It won’t be taboo<br>
                We’ve been playing games<br>
                Since we were two<br><br>

                Oh the games we used to play<br>
                The thrills of peek-a-boo<br>
                I could lie and say I envy those times<br>
                But I would rather be true<br><br>

                The games only got better<br>
                As the years flew by<br>
                We learned to play tag<br>
                and I spy with our little eyes<br><br>

                So back to the game<br>
                I told you we’d play<br>
                The best of them all<br>
                The one we’re already playing<br><br>

                A game full of tomorrows<br>
                Full of love and equal parts sorrow<br>
                Full of dreams and disappointment<br>
                pride and shame<br><br>

                It ends only in time<br>
                Every second another chance<br>
                A chance to do good<br>
                A chance to progress<br><br>

                There are no real winners or losers<br>
                Though we can name a few greats<br>
                The ones who made the world better<br>
                But not for the people’s praise<br><br>

                There was one who once screamed<br>
                “I have a dream”<br>
                And he died a martyr<br>
                But with an unforgotten legacy<br><br>

                Curiosity provokes the outstanding question:<br>
                How to achieve a desirable fate….<br>
                A life one can look back on while dying<br>
                And finding oneself in a blissful state<br><br>

                Your guess is as good as mine<br>
                Maybe we try to leave something behind<br><br>

                A mark on the world<br>
                A mark that will stand the tests of time<br>
                It’s like planting a tree<br>
                It’s working towards something you won’t get to see<br><br>

                Maybe it’s a simple act<br>
                Loving words to a wounded friend<br>
                Mending their heart<br>
                And providing courage to try again<br><br>

                Maybe our only task<br>
                Is to answer the door<br>
                When opportunity knocks<br>
                Before it is lost forevermore<br><br>

                However you play<br>
                It’s best not to forget<br>
                Playing games has always been fun<br>
                And this one’s no different<br>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                Words can’t explain<br>
                What a heart longs to tell<br>
                The secrets of young, pretty girls<br><br>

                She’s covered in youth<br>
                So what could she give?<br>
                How sudden, you’re lost in her curls.<br><br>

                And then there’s the boy.<br>
                That beautiful boy.<br>
                Who thinks he’s becoming a man<br><br>

                But when I look upon<br>
                The face I adore<br>
                I see only a lost Peter Pan.<br><br>

                So tell me dear Peter<br>
                if we were an island<br>
                how long would you ask me to stay?<br><br>

                would I be that Wendy?<br>
                your first in command<br>
                fighting pirates, and flying away<br><br>

                Or am I the Belle<br>
                who’s wings only break<br>
                Each time her poor heart understands<br><br>

                They’ll never be more<br>
                Than convenient, old friends<br>
                And she’ll never win love from that Pan.<br><br>

                To be an “adult”<br>
                They say that it means<br>
                To put childhood away on the shelf<br><br>

                What if being grown up<br>
                Isn’t being eighteen<br>
                Or having material wealth<br><br>

                Away with the plans<br>
                With all of the dreams<br>
                The things I’ve been desperate to do<br><br>

                I don’t want to be big<br>
                No, I’d rather be small.<br>
                And stay on the island with you.<br><br>
