                    There was a man who lived all his life in a sunny place. He grew up in this town where the sun always shined, where his hair was bleached by it, his skin browned by it. He went to school there, eventually brought up a family of his own there, lived out
                    his life, and then . . . when he was good and old, after his wife passed and he could no longer care for himself on his own, he was forced to move to another part of the country to be with his only daughter. It was a cold and rainy
                    place and the man didn't like that one bit.<br><br> He would often sit by the window waiting for the sun to poke through the clouds. For days at a time, he would sit. And wait. And then . . . one day, it did. The
                    rain stopped, the sun shone. He grabbed his cane and with a little hop to his step he went outside for a walk. His good fortune was short-lived, though, because while he was out, it started to rain again. Too far from home and grumbling,
                    he quickly stopped in at the nearest drugstore to buy an umbrella. <br><br> A little more stooped and already sopping, he was straggling home when, on his way he noticed school was letting out. A mother and a child scurried toward
                    him from the opposite direction. The mother had a toddler swaddled in her own rain jacket, but no hood for herself, and the young one would rather stomp in puddles than keep up. As they got near, on impulse, the man thrust his umbrella
                    at them. The mother stopped to look at him, and with the umbrella between them, they were all dripping wet now. She shook her head no, but the man pointed, explaining that he was nearly home already. She wondered how she would get
                    the umbrella back to him, but he said, “Take it. It's yours.” And without a backward glance, he was on his way again, head bowed to the relentless rain.<br><br> Back at home, the man's daughter met him at the door. “You're all wet,”
                    she said, and immediately apologized like she always did, knowing how he hated the bad weather. As if she had any control over it.<br><br> The next day, when there was a break in the drizzle, the man went for another walk, and this
                    time he got a little further before the downpour began. He bought two umbrellas from a different store clerk. It wasn't hard to find someone without. In fact, he gave up his own umbrella like he had the day before and walked home,
                    again, in the rain. <br><br> This time when his daughter confronted him, he was wet, but smiling.<br><br> It went on like this for months, years even. He became known as the umbrella man. He learned the people's names, their backstories.
                    They would call out to him on the street, not because they were in need of an umbrella, but because he'd given them one before. He eventually had boxes of umbrellas mailed to his home so that he would have his stockpile ready before
                    he even left the house.<br><br> His daughter would often beg him, seeing him always as a sopping mess, “Surely you have enough umbrellas,” she'd say. “Keep one for yourself.” But always there was someone who needed it more. He traded
                    even his cane in for an umbrella, then went hobbling home without, wanting only to be that little bit of shelter from someone else's storm.<br><br> At the end of his life, his saddest days were the ones when the clouds never came,
                    and the sun shone bright . . . <br><br>
